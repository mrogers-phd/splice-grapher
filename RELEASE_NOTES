-------------------
SpliceGrapher-0.2.7
-------------------
 * Added '--mindepth' option to predict_graphs.py, to enforce
   a minimum read depth for predicting AS events.
 * Modified scripts to ignore pysam installation if there
   are bugs in pysam imports.

-------------------
SpliceGrapher-0.2.6
-------------------
 * Added genewise_statistics.py to generate tables of AS
   events per gene.

-------------------
SpliceGrapher-0.2.5
-------------------
 * Converted ksh scripts to bash to eliminate need for users
   to install ksh.

-------------------
SpliceGrapher-0.2.4
-------------------
 * Added SpliceGrapher depths files as an alternative to SAM
   files to improve performance and SAM/BAM flexibility.

-------------------
SpliceGrapher-0.2.3
-------------------
 * Added a new pipeline (psginfer_pipeline.py) that can predict
   transcripts from splice graphs using PSGInfer.
 * Now retains start/stop codon locations from gene models.
 * SAM module can now handle more complex CIGAR strings that
   represent multi-exon reads, hard clipping and soft clipping.
 * Added an extended tutorial (RNA-Seq-tutorial.tgz) to
   provide a more comprehensive RNA-Seq analysis example.

-------------------
SpliceGrapher-0.2.2
-------------------
 * Initial "SpliceGrapherXT" release
 * Added a new realignment procedure (realignment_pipeline.py)
   that can resolve exons not defined in initial predictions.
 * Added a new pipeline (isolasso_pipeline.py) that can predict
   transcripts from splice graphs using IsoLasso.
 * Fixed defects in GTF processing.
 * Fixed defects in SAM processing related to CIGAR strings.

-------------------
SpliceGrapher-0.2.1
-------------------
 * Added a new predict_graphs.py script that can predict
   splice graphs genome-wide or chromosome-wide (see User's
   Guide for more information).
 * Improved GTF modules to read Cufflinks output files as well
   as most gene model files from the ENSEMBL, UCSC or iGenome websites.
 * Added highlighting feature for read depth figures: positions
   within the highlight region are colored red.
 * Added highlighting for acceptor and donor sites in splice
   junction figures.

-------------------
SpliceGrapher-0.2.0
-------------------
 * Second significant release marks a move toward simplifying the
   filtering and prediction process for users to make SpliceGrapher
   easier for biologists to use right away.
 * Simplified the use model for filtering SAM files by providing
   pre-built classifiers along with a new tool, sam_filter.py
 * Revised prediction algorithm is much simpler and faster than
   previous versions.
 * Package now handles gene models in either GTF or GFF3 format.
 * Added environment variables SG_GENE_MODEL and SG_FASTA_REF as
   an alternative to using SpliceGrapher configuration files.
 * Replaced the old documentation with a new Quick Start guide
   and a User's Guide that includes a brief tutorial.

-------------------
SpliceGrapher-0.1.0
-------------------
 * First significant release coincides with SpliceGrapher publication
   in Genome Biology (http://genomebiology.com/2012/13/1/R4).
 * Added the capability to shrink introns in all plots including
   splice graphs, isoforms, read coverage and splice junctions.
 * Added new methods for identifying specific isoforms in a splice
   graph and generating separate graphs for them.  See the methods
   'isoforms', 'isoformDict' and 'isoformGraph' in SpliceGraph.py.
 * Removed 'AltB' from statistics script because (a) there is no
   consensus on the correct definition and (b) it causes confusion
   when statistics change between gene models and predictions.
 * Graphs generated from PSL files (EST alignments) now include
   EST identifiers as isoform names.

-------------------
SpliceGrapher-0.0.5
-------------------
 * Added script for identifying the splice forms represented in a set
   of RNA-Seq data.
 * Added a new plotting module that uses configuration files so that
   users may save configurations for specific sets of plots
 * Improved the spacing and centering of objects in the splice graph
   and splice junction views
 * Added an isoform view that allows users to depict a gene's isoforms
   as individual graphs

-------------------
SpliceGrapher-0.0.4
-------------------
 * Added filtering for spliced alignments using predicted splice site
   database to remove false-positive junctions from SAM files.
 * Added workaround for Python copy.deepcopy limitation that prevented
   copying of splice graphs with more than 220 nodes.
 * Improvements to visualization scripts to allow users to control font
   sizes and to improve the appearance of legends.
 * Added Latex formatting to splicegraph_statistics.py script to make it
   easy to include results in Latex tables.
 * SpliceGrapher now requires PyML version 0.7.7
